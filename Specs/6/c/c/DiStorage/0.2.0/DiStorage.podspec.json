  "description": "DiStorage is a lightweight dependency injection library for swift.\nThe main advantage is the small amount of code (something like 200 lines).\nTherefore, you can look at code and be sure that the program does not contain any back doors and so on.\nAlso, the library demonstrates what dependency injection is and how similar libraries work.\nThe latter is important for beginning developers.",
