  "description": "The TIKI APIs comprise a set of HTTP REST APIs designed for seamless integration with any\nstandard HTTP client. The Client Libraries serve as a user-friendly layer around the TIKI APIs,\nintroducing methods for common operations such as authorization, licensing, capture, card-linked\noffers, and rewards. It is a collection of pre-existing code with minimal dependencies, offering\na streamlined integration process with TIKI Rest APIs, which reduces the amount of code necessary\nfor integration.\n\nTikiClient is the top-level entry point for the TIKI Client Library. It offers simple methods\nthat call the underlying libraries to perform common operations. Programmers can use it to\nsimplify the integration process or opt for individual libraries based on their specific needs.",
