  "description": "Are you passionate about building consumer grade mobile apps? Not sure where to start? Do your eyes hurt from hunting down answers on Stack Overflow? EasyApp is a collection of components, libraries, and extensions that make it super easy to develop consumer grade mobile platforms with a focus simple but clear user experiences. It consolidates a lot of the progress I've made so far in my own career as a developer and utilizes some of the best third party libraries I've found. It aims to provide iOS developers with most of the building blocks needed to get the ball rolling on projects that involve a lot of common features like user accounts, location services, generic table and collection view mechanics, login and onboarding, Core Data, delegation, networking, connectivity, and more. Feel free to drop me a line if you have feedback or are interested in collaborating on a new project. Thanks for checking it out, and I hope you find it useful!'",
