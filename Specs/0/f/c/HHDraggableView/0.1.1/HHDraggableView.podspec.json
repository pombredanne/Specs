  "description": "HHDraggableUIView is a highly customizable, easy-to-use draggable UIView for iOS apps, perfect for creating interactive components that can be freely moved around the screen. This UIView subclass supports enabling and disabling drag capabilities, applying inertia to movements, and optionally snapping the view to the sides of the screen once dragging ends.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Simple to integrate with just a few lines of code.\n- Full support for @IBDesignable properties, making it easy to configure via Interface Builder.\n- Optional inertia that simulates a natural continuation of movement based on initial drag speed.\n- An option to snap the view to the nearest side, enhancing the UI experience by aligning views neatly.\n- Customizable friction for inertia and boundary conditions to keep the view within screen limits.\n\nIdeal for apps requiring interactive elements like sliders, floating action buttons, panels, or any component that benefits from on-screen repositioning.",
