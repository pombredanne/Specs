  "description": "Amazon Sidewalk Mobile SDK provides a one-stop shop for everything related to Amazon Sidewalk on mobiles. It has its own Bluetooth and network stack, and is able to communicate to both the edge device (over BLE) and the Amazon Sidewalk cloud. Currently, the Amazon Sidewalk Mobile SDK exports the underlying Alexa Mobile Accessory (AMA) BLE stack, and allows applications to scan for AMA beaconing devices and then provision these devices over AMA to use the Amazon Sidewalk network. It handles the interaction between the Amazon Sidewalk cloud and edge device, exchanging keys and registering the edge device, so that the edge device can connect to the Amazon Sidewalk network via Amazon Sidewalk gateways. Authentication is provided via integration with Login with Amazon (LWA).\n\nAmazon Sidewalk Mobile SDK is designed to assist developers in integrating common Amazon Sidewalk user controls into developersâ€™ own mobile applications for controls such as the endpoint registration and de-registration. Amazon Sidewalk Mobile SDK is able to communicate to both the endpoint (over BLE) and the Amazon Sidewalk cloud.\n\nAmazon Sidewalk Mobile SDK applications are required to integrate with Login with Amazon (LWA) SDK to collect a user Auth Token for issuing Amazon Sidewalk controls. The iOS Mobile SDK also requires OpenSSL.",
