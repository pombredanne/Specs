  "summary": "Add the missing network activity indicator on newer iPhones",
  "description": "Since iOS 18, network activity indicator is no longer displayed. iPhones with a notch\nor Dynamic Island never displayed it. This pod brings it back by placing an activity\nindicator in the upper right of the screen on top of the regular status bar items\n(on top of the clock on iPhone SE running iOS 18+).\nSince a circular indicator wouldn't fit, a rectangular \"KITT scanner\" like indicator\nwith a gradient is shown. The indicator UI can be used standalone or as a \"fix\" for\nthe iOS network activity indicator (using the existing API).",
